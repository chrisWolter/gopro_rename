# GoPro chaptered video renaming tool

This tool renames Gopro chaptered videos to a better name convention for better sorting.
The files are renamed from: GH010001 and GH020001 to GH010001_1 and GH010001_2. With this new naming convention Windows and Mac can sort the files better.

## Warning
This Tool is currently under development. I cant ensure that your files are working properly after renaming, so please make sure you have a copy of your files.

## Instalation

You need to install Node for using this tool. You can Download Node [Here!](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

To use the Gopro Rename Tool open your command line (cmd) and got to the root where you save the rename.js file. 
``` bash
 cd <Your Path>
 ```

 When you are in the correct Path you can run the file with
 ``` bash
 node app.js 
 ```

and just hit enter. Then you have to Select your Gopro Model and enter your file Path where your Gopro Files are located.

## Roadmap

Im currently Working to enhance the renaming Tool and in the future I want to implement these tools:

1: Dont rename a second time if the tool jsut run once over your files
2: Undo Renaming

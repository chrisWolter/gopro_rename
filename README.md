# GoPro chaptered video renaming tool

This tool renames Gopro chaptered videos to a better name convention for better sorting.
The files are renamed from: GH010001 and GH020001 to GH010001_1 and GH010001_2. With this new naming convention Windows and Mac can sort the files better.

## Warning

This Tool is currently under development. I cant ensure that your files are working properly after renaming, so please make sure you have a copy of your files.

## Instalation

You need to install Node for using this tool. You can Download Node [Here!](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

To use the Gopro Rename Tool open your command line (cmd) and got to the root where you the app.js file is located.

```bash
 cd <Your Path>
```

When you are in the correct Path you can run the file with

```bash
node app.js
```

and just hit enter. Then you have to Select your Gopro Model and enter your file Path where your Gopro Files are located. Then the Programm will show you a List with all Files that will be renamed and what the new filename will be. If you want to rename those files you can choose if these files should be copied and renaimed in a subfolder so the original files wouldnt be touched. If you choose not to copy and rename the files in the main folder will be renamed.

## Roadmap

Im currently Working to enhance the renaming Tool and in the future I want to implement these tools:

~~1: Add an CLI~~

~~2: Show what files would be renamed and select if it is ok to rename.~~

~~3: Dont rename a second time if the tool jsut run once over your files~~

4: start Programm directly via command line with a keyword

5: Undo Renaming

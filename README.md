# GoPro Auto Renaming Tool

!! This Tool is currently under development. I cant ensure that your files are working properly after renaming, so please make sure you have a copy of your files.

This Tool renames Gopro Chaptered Videos to a better name convention for better sorting.
The files are renamed from: GH010001 and GH020001 to GH010001 (1) and GH010001 (2). With this new naming convention Windows and MAC can sort the files better.

! This Tool only works for Gopro Hero 6-8, but i will implement renaming of Hero - Hero 5 and Fusion/Max Footage Soon.

## Instalation

You need to install Node for using this tool. You can Download Node [Here!](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

To use the Gopro Rename Tool open your command line (cmd) and got to the root where you save the rename.js file. 
``` bash
 cd <Your Path>
 ```

 When you are in the correct Path you can run the file with
 ``` bash
 node rename.js <Path to gopro files to rename>
 ```

and just hit enter.
